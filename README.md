# How it works

## Getting started
SingWithAvatars project focuses on singing learning to an artificial intelligence.  <br/> DNN is used for acoustic classification problem (not here), 
signal processing and speech synthesis features are also used to generate a song. 

### How to generate a song
To generate a song from default acoustic model and datasets, you must use the following command:

```
python generate.py
```
This command will create a song from test data.<br/>
You can find the output file in folder named "output"
